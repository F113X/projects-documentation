## Features

- Solid diode ladder filter topology, smooth filter sweeps
- Two CV inputs and attenuators to modulate cutoff frequency
- Input level adjustment to allow for overdriving filter circuit

## Quirks and Problems

- Resonance knob is backwards
- Resonance control isn't very sensitive, one small movement may go from no resonance to harsh self oscillation
- CV attenuator does not attenuate the full range
