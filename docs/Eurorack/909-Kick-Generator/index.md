## Features

- Authentic 909/x0x style Kick
- Manual and CV control over Pitch
- Tone and Drive controls for a variety of kick flavours
- Decay for frequency and amplitude
- Accent CV as offset for internal VCA

## Quirks and Problems

- Works fine, Tone knob can be considered backwards (cw = duller sound, ccw = brighter sound)
- Does not trigger the same with all trigger signals, weak triggers can lead to weak sound.
