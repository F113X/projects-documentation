## Features

- Authentic 606/x0x style Hihat
- Manual and CV control over Pitch
- Bridged-T bandpass filter as Tone
- CV control over Decay
- Accent CV as offset for internal VCA

## Quirks and Problems

- Pitch adjustment sounds weird, and FM is also weird
- Decay can only be adjusted with a dummy cable connecting to the Decay CV input
- Hihat sound has a lot of low end, frequency of high pass filter is not high enough
