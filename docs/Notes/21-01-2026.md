I think how most people understands the current state of AI is akin to how people knew the internet and computers during the 90s (or around that time i didn't exist back then): a huge black box that is super high tech but the inner workings are basically magic. 

From that I can also infer that the AI bubble will burst in the same way the dotcom bubble burst.
