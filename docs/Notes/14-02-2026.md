I just realized that because synths and especially modular is quite a niche field, it is unlikely that your friends can immediately do stuff on your devices other than fiddle with the knobs. 

If you were into photography for example, your friends could take your camera and take pictures and stuff, and potentially take some half-decent images without needing to know any "advanced features" on the camera. That would probably be the same for some other "tech related" hobbies and some tech savvy friends. 

But for synthesizers (especially modular), there are typically so many parameters that it is difficult for anyone who doesn't know what they're doing to produce sound. Even if they find the volume knob maybe the cutoff is all the way closed and there still wouldn't be sound. 

Even if your friend finds the play button on a groovebox, what if it's on a blank sequence? They could only randomly press buttons and turn knobs and get frustrated after a while. 

So get a synth, the best scary looking machine that is mostly friend proof :D

I don't know why I came up with this, just an interesting thought.
